        <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>The term software engineering is composed of two word, software and engineering. Software is more than just a program code. A program is an executable code, which servers some computational purpose.<br></p><p style="text-indent: 20px;">Software is consider to be executable programming code, associated libraries and documentations. Engineering on the other hand, is all about developing products using well defined scientific principle and methods.</p></p><p style="text-indent: 20px;">So we cab define software engineering as an engineering branch associated with the development of software product using the well define scientific principle  method and procedure.</p><p style="text-indent: 20px;">The outcome of software engineering is an efficient on reliable software products. <strong>IEEE</strong>&#40 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers &#41 define software engineering as the application of systematic, discipline, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software. </p>

        <h6>Need of Software Engineering</h6>
        <p>The need of Software Engineering arise because of higher rate of change in user requirements and environment on which the software is working.</p>

        <h6>Large Software</h6>
        <p>It is easier to build a wall than to a house, likewise as the size of software become large, Engineering has to step up to give it a scientific procedure.</p>

        <h6>Sociability</h6>
        <p>If the software process were not based on scientific and engineering concept, it would be easier to recreate new software than to scale an existing one.</p>

        <h6>Cost</h6>
        <p>As hardware industry has shown its skills and view, manufacturing has lower down the price of computer and electronic hardware, but the cost of software remains high as proper process is not adopted.</p>

        <h6>Dynamic Nature</h6>
        <p>The always growing and adapting nature of software usually depends upon the environment in which the user work. If the nature of software is always changing, new enhancement need to be done. This is where software engineering place a good role.</p>
        
        <h6>Quality Management</h6>
        <p>Better process of software development provides better and quality software product.</p>

        <h3 id="char">Characteristics of Good Software</h3>
        <p>A software product can be judged by what it offers and how well it can be used. This software must satisfy on the following grounds:
            <ul>
                <li>Operational</li>
                <li>Transitional</li>
                <li>Maintenance</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Well Engineering</h4>
        <h6>&#40i&#41 Operational</h6>
        <p>This tell how well software works in operation. It can be measured on: 
            <ul>
                <li>Usability</li>
                <li>Efficiency</li>
                <li>Correctness</li>
                <li>Functionality</li>
                <li>Dependability</li>
                <li>Security</li>
                <li>Safety</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h6>&#40ii&#41 Transitional</h6>
        <p>This aspect is important when the software is moved from one platform to another:
            <ul>
                <li>Inter operability</li>
                <li>Reusability</li>
                <li>Adaptability</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h6>&#40iii&#41 Maintenance</h6>
        <p>This aspect briefs about how well a software has the capabilities to maintain itself in the ever changing environment: 
            <ul>
                <li>Modularity</li>
                <li>Maintainability</li>
                <li>Flexibility</li>
                <li>Scalability</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>In short we can say software engineering is a way which tells us to make a software by using well define engineering concept required to efficient, durable, scalable, in budget and on time software product.</p>

        <h3 id="cycle">Software Development Life Cycle</h3>
        <h4>Lifecycle Model</h4>
        <p>A Software Life Cycle model &#40 called as process model &#41 is a descriptive and diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle. A lifecycle model represents all the activities required to make a software product. In other words, a lifecycle model maps the different activities perform on a software software product from its inception to retirement. During any life cycle phase, more than one activity make also be carried out.</p>

        <h4>Need for Software Life Cycle Model</h4>
        <p>The development team must identify a suitable and then adhere to it. Without using of a particular life cycle model the development of a software product would not be in a systematic and disciplined manner. When a software product is being developed by a team there must be a clear understanding among team members about when and what to do. Otherwise it would lead to chaos and project failure.</p>

        <h4 id="types_models">Types of different Lifecycle Models</h4>
        <p>Many life cycle model have been proposed so far, each of them has some advantages as well as some disadvantages. A few important and commonly used lifecycle models are as follows:
            <ol type="I">
                <li>Classical waterfall Model</li>
                <li>Iterative waterfall Model</li>
                <li>Prototyping Model</li>
                <li>Evolutionary Model</li>
                <li>Spiral Model</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
